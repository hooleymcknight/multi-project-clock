# Multi-Project Clock

#### This app handles multiple stopwatches to help people track multiple timers.

This app was developed originally for freelancers to track time on multiple projects, so when a new timer is started, previous ones are paused.

## Future updates

- dark mode toggle
- user should get a prompt after clicking delete client button: "are you sure?"
- edit time
- stop and save active timer on window close
- edit name should submit on Enter key press
- simultaneous timer mode (multiple timers can run at once)
