# Multi-Project Clock

#### This app handles multiple stopwatches to help people track multiple timers.

This app was developed originally for freelancers to track time on multiple projects, so when a new timer is started, previous ones are paused.

## Recent updates

- active timer stops and saves when window is closed
- edit name submits on Enter key press
- timers now save user data on Reset button click
- dark mode toggle
- new app icon
- Esc key in edit name cancels edit
- user gets a prompt after clicking delete client button: "are you sure?"
- indicator on toolbar icon that a timer is active (taskbar icon overlay)
- duplicate client names no longer allowed (causes bugs & confusion)

## Future updates

- edit time
- reorder clients
- sum line for total hours for the day
- clear all button
- lock screen feature
- simultaneous timer mode (multiple timers can run at once)
- combine start/stop into a single button that toggles, and reduce the size of the "restart" button
- add thumbnail toolbars for taskbar control
- put taskbar icon overlay in top-right corner
- simultaneous timer mode icon overlay shows number of live timers
- make use of helpers/menu.js rather than having the menu template in main.js
