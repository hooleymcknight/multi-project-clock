# Multi-Project Clock

#### This app handles multiple stopwatches to help people track multiple timers.

This app was developed originally for freelancers to track time on multiple projects, so when a new timer is started, previous ones are paused.

## Future updates

- edit name should submit on Enter key press
- timers should save user data on Reset button click
- stop and save active timer on window close
- dark mode toggle
- new app icon
- user should get a prompt after clicking delete client button: "are you sure?"
- edit time
- simultaneous timer mode (multiple timers can run at once)
- lock screen feature
- indicator on toolbar icon that a timer is active
- combine start/stop into a single button that toggles, and reduce the size of the "restart" button
